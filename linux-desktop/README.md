# Nyano Desktop

This directory contains a minimal Electron application that serves as the foundation for a Nyano desktop wallet and mining interface for Linux. The UI now includes simple "Wallet" and "Miner" buttons and displays the host platform using an exposed preload API.

## Install dependencies

```
cd linux-desktop
npm install
```

## Run the app

```
npm start
```

This is a starting point. Future work can integrate wallet functionality, mining controls, and additional features inspired by platforms like Kraken. The interface uses Font Awesome icons bundled via `npm`.
